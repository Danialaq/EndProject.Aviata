The topic of our endterm project is "Online purchase of air tickets". The aim of this project is to create service where clients can buy tickets to ten countries and director can manage the data of every flight. Director can have the access to all information by entering correct password (201291). Admin (director) can get information about all flights, search flights by id, date and destination point; can delete flights by its id. Clients buy tickets by entering his or her name, country, departure date, departure time. All the changed data is stored in the database.
